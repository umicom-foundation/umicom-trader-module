# Umicom Trader Module

Thin C23 application composition for the Umicom Trader product.

The module intentionally contains **no duplicated trading, market-data, risk,
selection-routing or linked-workbench logic**. Those reusable capabilities live
in Umicom Framework. This first module phase consumes the Framework-owned
Trader/TMS workbench profile and exposes it as a product-specific composition.

Current composition:

- Trading group: `trading.red`
- Operations group: `operations.green`
- Watchlist
- Chart
- Order Entry
- Account Selector
- Risk
- Trade Blotter
- Context Inspector

Future Trader batches can add product-specific presentation and broker adapters,
while canonical instruments, accounts, trades, risk and context routing remain
Framework responsibilities.
